# MSc-AI-GeneticAlgorithm

## Implementation of a Genetic Algorithm in Python.

This git contains two sample files for genetic algorithm implementations.

### GAimplementation.py

Genetic Algorithm implementation that finds the coefficients desired in a mathematical function.

### survivalTest.py

Solution to a Knapsack problem, in this example a set of 9 different survival tools were used, granting the most value points to gear that is more useful in a 'camping/wilderness survival' situation.
